# Imdb-scrapy
My attempt to clone the effort at [GraphTV](http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/)

tldr; Plot the ratings of all episodes of a TV series

## Why?
- This project is helping me learn Python
- GraphTV does not have all the series I want to look up

## How?
The tech I have used:
- To scrap IMDB for ratings - [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/)
- To plot the graph - _undecided_
